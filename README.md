![Alt text](/demo.gif?raw=true "Demo")

## Installation

Install using npm or yarn. Requires React 16.8+.

```bash
npm install react-files --save
```

## Basic Usage

```js
import React from 'react'
import Files from 'react-files'

const FileDropzone = () => {
  const handleChange = (files) => {
    console.log(files)
  }

  const handleError = (error, file) => {
    console.log('error code ' + error.code + ': ' + error.message)
  }

  return (
    <div className="files">
      <Files
        className='files-dropzone'
        onChange={handleChange}
        onError={handleError}
        accepts={['image/png', '.pdf', 'audio/*']}
        multiple
        maxFileSize={10000000}
        minFileSize={0}
        clickable>
        Drop files here or click to upload
      </Files>
    </div>
  )
}
```

## Upgrading to Version 3

Most of the changes made to version 3 are internal, but there are some notable and breaking changes:
1. The most significant change is that `react-files` no longer manages state internally to track files that have been uploaded to a file list. This can be achieved quite simply however - please refer to the [`ListWithUpload` example](https://github.com/mother/react-files/blob/master/examples/ListWithUpload.js).
2. `dropActiveClassName` prop has been renamed to `dragActiveClassName`.
2. Removed unnecessary parent/wrapper `div` element. No more default values for `className` or `dragActiveClassName` props.
3. Ability to pass in a render prop with a prop that indicates whether a drag is in progress. See the [`RenderProps` example](https://github.com/mother/react-files/blob/master/examples/RenderProps.js).
4. Ability to pass in attributes to underlying input
